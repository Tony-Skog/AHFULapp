## Project Overview -- AHFUL App

A Helpful Fitness Utilization Logger (AHFUL) app is an Open Source Web App for tracking workouts, food, gyms, and measurements. The repository contains a Python-based backend (Hosted APIs) under the `Backend/` and a React-based UI under the `Frontend/` folder.

## Use Cases:
- Your Health in a Glance -- Our software is designed for coaching users throughout their fitness journey. When the user enters the app, they will see a summary of their previous workout and body metrics history if they choose to record them. (Dashboard-esque feeling). The home page can be customizable for the user.
- Workout Planning and Recording -- Standard Gym Member mode will offer an option for users to record their workouts by adding exercises to a list of completed exercises for each workout. The User can also add the number of repetitions or the weight they moved during the workout.
- Body Measurement Tracking Database and History -- In Gym Member mode, the user can enter and record body measurements, such as Arm or leg circumference and Body weight, etc.
- Built-in Gym Discovery & Marketing Ideas -- The app will also be built so users can find gyms that use the app for their fitness coaching / personal trainer programs, and it will list the brands and names of the Gyms we work with.
- Promote your own Business within our App -- Personal trainers will also have access to the application, where they can manage clients, assign workouts, and assign exercises and repetitions to their clients.
- Live Activities, Notifications, and Routines -- The software will also use notifications and reminders to notify users when workouts are due and to provide motivation.
- AI Incorporation and Workout Planning -- We can incorporate AI into the mix to plan workouts, serve as a fitness research partner, and possibly serve as a substitute for a personal trainer.
- The Endless world of Fitness -- This tool is essentially endless, and you could incorporate all aspects of fitness management, diet, water intake, etc. The scope will be determined after the group is created. Gym Buddy System.
